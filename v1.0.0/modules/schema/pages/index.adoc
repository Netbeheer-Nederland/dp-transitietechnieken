| +++Connectivity nodes are points where terminals of AC conducting equipment are connected together with zero impedance.+++

| xref::class/EnergyConnection.adoc[`EnergyConnection`]
| +++A connection of energy generation or consumption on the power system model.+++

| xref::class/EnergyConsumer.adoc[`EnergyConsumer`]
| +++Generic user of energy - a  point of consumption on the power system model.
EnergyConsumer.pfixed, .qfixed, .pfixedPct and .qfixedPct have meaning only if there is no LoadResponseCharacteristic associated with EnergyConsumer or if LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is set to False.+++

| xref::class/Equipment.adoc[`Equipment`]
| +++The parts of a power system that are physical devices, electronic or mechanical.+++

| xref::class/IdentifiedObject.adoc[`IdentifiedObject`]
| +++This is a root class to provide common identification for all classes needing identification and naming attributes.+++

| xref::class/Location.adoc[`Location`]
| +++The place, scene, or point of something where someone or something has been, is, and/or will be at a given moment in time. It can be defined with one or more position points (coordinates) in a given coordinate system.+++

| xref::class/MarketEvaluationPoint.adoc[`MarketEvaluationPoint`]
| +++The identification of an entity where energy products are measured or computed.+++

| xref::class/MktConnectivityNode.adoc[`MktConnectivityNode`]
| +++Subclass of IEC61970:Topology:ConnectivityNode.+++

| xref::class/Name.adoc[`Name`]
| +++The Name class provides the means to define any number of human readable  names for an object. A name is <b>not</b> to be used for defining inter-object relationships. For inter-object relationships instead use the object identification 'mRID'.+++

| xref::class/NameType.adoc[`NameType`]
| +++Type of name. Possible values for attribute 'name' are implementation dependent but standard profiles may specify types. An enterprise may have multiple IT systems each having its own local name for the same object, e.g. a planning system may have different names from an EMS. An object may also have different names within the same IT system, e.g. localName as defined in CIM version 14. The definition from CIM14 is:
The localName is a human readable name of the object. It is a free text name local to a node in a naming hierarchy similar to a file directory structure. A power system related naming hierarchy may be: Substation, VoltageLevel, Equipment etc. Children of the same parent in such a hierarchy have names that typically are unique among them.+++

| xref::class/NameTypeAuthority.adoc[`NameTypeAuthority`]
| +++Authority responsible for creation and management of names of a given type; typically an organization or an enterprise system.+++

| xref::class/PowerSystemResource.adoc[`PowerSystemResource`]
| +++A power system resource (PSR) can be an item of equipment such as a switch, an equipment container containing many individual items of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have measurements associated.+++

| xref::class/RegisteredDistributedResource.adoc[`RegisteredDistributedResource`]
| +++A registered resource that represents a distributed energy resource, such as a micro-generator, fuel cell, photo-voltaic energy source, etc.+++

| xref::class/RegisteredLoad.adoc[`RegisteredLoad`]
| +++Model of a load that is registered to participate in the market.

RegisteredLoad is used to model any load that is served by the wholesale market directly. RegisteredLoads may be dispatchable or non-dispatchable and may or may not have bid curves. Examples of RegisteredLoads would include: distribution company load, energy retailer load, large bulk power system connected facility load.

Loads that are served indirectly, for example - through an energy retailer or a vertical utility, should be modeled as RegisteredDistributedResources. Examples of RegisteredDistributedResources would include: distribution level storage, distribution level generation and distribution level demand response.+++

| xref::class/RegisteredResource.adoc[`RegisteredResource`]
| +++A resource that is registered through the market participant registration system. Examples include generating unit, load, and non-physical generator or load.+++

| xref::class/ResourceCapacity.adoc[`ResourceCapacity`]
| +++This class model the various capacities of a resource. A resource may have numbers of capacities related to operating, ancillary services, energy trade and so forth. Capacities may be defined for active power or reactive power.+++

| xref::class/StreetAddress.adoc[`StreetAddress`]
| +++General purpose street and postal address information.+++

| xref::class/StreetDetail.adoc[`StreetDetail`]
| +++Street details, in the context of address.+++

| xref::class/TechnologiesDataSet.adoc[`TechnologiesDataSet`]
| +++A single instance of a published dataset.+++

| xref::class/Terminal.adoc[`Terminal`]
| +++An AC electrical connection point to a piece of conducting equipment. Terminals are connected at physical connection points called connectivity nodes.+++

| xref::class/UsagePoint.adoc[`UsagePoint`]
| +++Logical or physical point in the network to which readings or events may be attributed. Used at the place where a physical or virtual meter may be located; however, it is not required that a meter be present.+++

| xref::enumeration/UnitMultiplier.adoc[`UnitMultiplier`]
| +++The unit multipliers defined for the CIM.  When applied to unit symbols, the unit symbol is treated as a derived unit. Regardless of the contents of the unit symbol text, the unit symbol shall be treated as if it were a single-character unit symbol. Unit symbols should not contain multipliers, and it should be left to the multiplier to define the multiple for an entire data type. 

For example, if a unit symbol is "m2Pers" and the multiplier is "k", then the value is k(m**2/s), and the multiplier applies to the entire final value, not to any individual part of the value. This can be conceptualized by substituting a derived unit symbol for the unit type. If one imagines that the symbol "Þ" represents the derived unit "m2Pers", then applying the multiplier "k" can be conceptualized simply as "kÞ".

For example, the SI unit for mass is "kg" and not "g".  If the unit symbol is defined as "kg", then the multiplier is applied to "kg" as a whole and does not replace the "k" in front of the "g". In this case, the multiplier of "m" would be used with the unit symbol of "kg" to represent one gram.  As a text string, this violates the instructions in IEC 80000-1. However, because the unit symbol in CIM is treated as a derived unit instead of as an SI unit, it makes more sense to conceptualize the "kg" as if it were replaced by one of the proposed replacements for the SI mass symbol. If one imagines that the "kg" were replaced by a symbol "Þ", then it is easier to conceptualize the multiplier "m" as creating the proper unit "mÞ", and not the forbidden unit "mkg".+++

| xref::enumeration/UnitSymbol.adoc[`UnitSymbol`]
| +++The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived unit is equal to an SI unit. Whenever possible, the standard derived symbol is used instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the unit symbol Farad is defined as "F" instead of "CPerV". In cases where a standard symbol does not exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit is used as the unit symbol. For example, density does not have a standard symbol and so it is represented as "kgPerm3". With the exception of the "kg", which is an SI unit, the unit symbols do not contain multipliers and therefore represent the base derived unit to which a multiplier can be applied as a whole. 
Every unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if it were a single-letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.
To allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from the format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol "/" is replaced by the letters "Per". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit as "m3" instead of being formatted as "m" with a superscript of 3  or introducing a symbol as in "m^3". The degree symbol "°" is replaced with the letters "deg". Any clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included in the description for the unit symbol.
Non-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to be correctly labelled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that is reporting numbers that represent feet instead of meters). This allows software to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw data of those sources into SI-based units. 
The integer values are used for harmonization with IEC 61850.+++

| xref::enumeration/YesNo.adoc[`YesNo`]
| +++Used as a flag set to Yes or No.+++
