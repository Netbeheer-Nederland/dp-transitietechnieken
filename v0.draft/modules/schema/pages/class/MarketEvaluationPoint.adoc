| +++If true, this usage point is virtual, i.e., no physical location exists in the network where a meter could be located to collect the meter readings. For example, one may define a virtual usage point to serve as an aggregation of usage for all of a company's premises distributed widely across the distribution territory. Otherwise, the usage point is physical, i.e., there is a logical point in the network where a meter could be located to collect meter readings.+++
